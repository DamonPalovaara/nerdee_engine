At this point I'm just messing around with shaders.  Before I get too far I want to port over to using gfx-hal (docs.rs/gfx-hal/0.4.0/gfx_hal/)  Reasons for porting:
* Weak community support
* In-complete documentation
* Hard to get help due to last two items
* gfx_hal supports multiple apis/platforms including wasm
